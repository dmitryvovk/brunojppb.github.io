          <p>
              Working at woom is a joy and challenging at the same time. We deal with a large scale infrastructure that spams across many continents (EU, North America, Asia) and yet we are still a startup with a very small and efficient team. And c'mon! we make bikes for kids. How cool is it? isn't just cool, it's awesome! 
              <br /><br />
              On the technical side, I am writing high-scale, cloud-based applications using Scala and the Play framework for high concurrency and high availability for our very international and remote team. I am currently focused on rebuilding our whole international e-commerce experience from scratch using Typescript, GraphQL, Apollo and Vue.js with Nuxt.
              <br /><br />
              On top of that, I deeply care about soft skills (commonly underrated among the software community), mainly focusing on good communication and putting people first, making sure I can pass the message in an understandable and friendly way, specially for Non-tech-savvy users.

          <p>
              I wanted to keep all my cards in a safe place that I was sure nobody was tracking me or uploading my cards to any server. I decided to build my own solution.<br /><br />
              Card Vault is the go-to app if you want to keep all your cards in a single place. You can scan them automatically.
              It is also saved safely protected with password, FaceID or TouchID.<br />
              You can download it on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/card-vault-lite/id1389892665">App Store</a>

              Also working with DevOps using SaltStack and TeamCity to automate our entire deployment process and servers management.

              On the mobile side I have worked with iOS development, mainly using the Swift programming language and the iOS Cocoa Touch framework.
